# Validation — 17 September 2026

- All 72 product assets are present as high-resolution square WebP photographs. The generated catalogue and all product detail templates point to the corresponding stone assets.
- All pen image markup across 174 templates has stone styling; the 130 catalogue image mappings resolve to the 65 matching compound photographs.
- Every newly generated image was visually reviewed. Text recognition supplemented checks of compound names and quantities. The VIP spelling correction passed both checks. The existing CJC combination photograph uses its previously approved abbreviated name.
- Browser pagination expanded from 24 to 48 to 72 cards. All 72 cards have stone images; no broken image was reported and desktop overflow was absent at 1280 px. A screenshot immediately after pagination caught some photos still loading.
- The charcoal footer and gradient band were visually checked on the narrow preview. Earlier desktop and 390 px checks remain applicable to the unchanged footer CSS.
- Device photographs are illustrative design mockups, replacing the source icon placeholders. Product specifications and source business claims have not been independently verified.
- Local storefront only: live payments, account authentication and real orders remain outside this design update.

## Hero motion — 19 September 2026

- Desktop browser checks: three independent cursor transforms, different scroll speeds, stationary stone, smooth pointer-leave reset, and homepage route remount all pass.
- Reduced-motion preference restores the complete static image and removes moving layers. Mobile at 390 px uses restrained scroll motion, has no cursor glow, and has no horizontal overflow. Desktop checked at 1440 px.
- Inspected desktop, cursor and mobile screenshots in `qa/`. Pen wording and dial artwork reuse the existing source photo; no pen regeneration.
- No browser JavaScript errors during the checked flows. Re-run with `node qa/check-hero.cjs` (uses this machine's bundled Playwright and Chrome); `AXIOM_TEST_URL` can target the standalone HTML.

## Bahasa Indonesia — 23 October 2026

- EN / ID switch added to the navigation; 904 dictionary strings, 2 whole-headline translations and 17 number patterns in `i18n-id.json`.
- `qa/check-i18n.cjs` passes on the served site and the standalone HTML: all 170 routes in Indonesian with no English left, translated document titles, home filter and plan copy, basket drawer and toast, request-form validation, exact English restored when switching back, choice persists across reloads, mobile 390 px without overflow, no JavaScript errors.
- Hero checks still pass with the translated headline; pens keep their original label pixels. Screenshots: `qa/i18n-home-id.png`, `qa/i18n-product-id.png`, `qa/i18n-home-mobile-id.png`.
- Translations are machine-drafted against a fixed glossary; legal and certificate wording still needs a fluent reviewer.

## Lighter build and portable checks — 23 October 2026

- First load fetches CSS, two fonts and three scripts only: `content.js` 2.2 MB → 159 KB, `base.css` 510 KB → 100 KB (+49 KB and 27 KB fonts), standalone HTML 49.9 MB → 21.8 MB. The ZIP adds `pages/`, `i18n-id.js` and the font files. `original.css`, an identical copy of `base.css` used by nothing, is removed.
- Visual parity: all 170 routes at 1440 px and 390 px plus basket and mobile-menu states, screenshotted before and after and compared pixel by pixel. The only change on every page is the language label; the remaining differences were the random grain canvas and lazy related-product photos still loading, and a scroll check confirms every product, related and catalogue photo loads (no broken images).
- Lazy pages: a failed page chunk shows a translated message, keeps the current page and recovers on the next navigation. A saved Indonesian choice fetches the dictionary from `<head>` at high priority and holds the first paint until it applies.
- Inactive language label raised from 50 % to 65 % ivory: about 7:1 on the charcoal nav and above 4.5:1 where the 95 %-opaque nav sits over ivory sections.
- `qa/check-hero.cjs` and `qa/check-i18n.cjs` pass on the served site and the standalone HTML through the new `qa/browser.cjs` (no machine-specific path required).

## Readability and mobile buying — 23 October 2026

- Type floor 11px: 91 smaller sizes raised in the hand-written stylesheets, and `build.py` applies the same floor to `base.css` and stops on any regression. A browser audit of eight pages at 1440 px and the homepage at 390 and 360 px finds no text under 11px and no text below 4.5:1, apart from the skip link, which is only visible when focused. Fixed along the way: the ivory secondary grey (3.8–4.3:1 → 4.6–5.2:1), a 1.85:1 caption on the homepage, the homepage filter count, the footer legal line, the 01–03 markers and the "RUO" label in the ribbon, which was dark on dark.
- Language buttons are now 44px tall and breadcrumb links have a 24px hit area. The demo notice moved from a floating badge into the top ribbon.
- Shop header: at 1440×900 the first row of products now ends at 880px (before: cards started at 628px and ended below the fold). On a phone the categories are one scrolling row and the first product starts about 190px higher.
- Mobile buy bar (390 px): shows size and price at the top of a product page, steps aside when half of the size choices or Add to basket row is on screen, follows size changes (20 mg → Rp 3.600.000), adds through the page's own button, reads "Tambah ke keranjang" in Indonesian, and is gone on other pages. Hidden at desktop widths.
- `qa/check-hero.cjs` and `qa/check-i18n.cjs` pass on the served site and the standalone HTML.
- Found, not changed here: one click on Add to basket stores quantity 2, in this build and the previous one. It comes from the reference app.
